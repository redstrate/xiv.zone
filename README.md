This is the source code of the website hosted at [xiv.zone](https://xiv.zone/).

## Building

You need [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/installation/) (extended edition) to build the site.

To build the site, just run `hugo` and the built site will appear in `public`.

```
$ cd xiv.zone
$ hugo
```

For quick development, Hugo has a built-in HTTP server that auto-reloads on changes:

```
$ cd xiv.zone
$ hugo server
```
