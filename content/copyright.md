### The Actual Reality

This is just scary stuff I have to post on this website! In all seriousness, **please do not use my software for piracy.** 

There's also a reason why everything here is free and open source - please **do not attempt to make money** on Square Enix's copyrighted material. Donations made through this website is purely for **my support only** and software hosted here will never be paywalled.

As of 2022, the Final Fantasy XIV mod community is thriving and we have a relative amount of freedom when it comes to modifying and redistributing the game's data, and with reverse engineered source code and file formats. Please for the sake of all us, do not abuse this privilege as Square Enix could very easily take it away.
