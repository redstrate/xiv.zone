Have you ever wondered why your female FFXIV character's body shape mysteriously
changes depending on whatever you decide to wear? No more!

![main comparison](varc/main-comparison.png)

The main reason why I created this mod is that some of the armors in the game do
not properly fit "large chested" female characters like my Viera. Compared to other mods that are refitting it to a completely different (and usually ridiculously NSFW) body type, this is meant for people who are fine with the vanilla body like me.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How do I install this?

This is a [Penumbra](https://github.com/xivdev/Penumbra) mod, so simply drag it into your Penumbra mods folder (normally located in `Mods` folder in your `Documents`).

### Do you plan on making a TexTools version?

No.

### Why isn't this mod doing anything?

This mod changes the weight painting and vertices very slightly, and you may not notice any changes depending on your race. Please remember that I've only modified the **Hyur Female Midlander** armor, and will only affect races that use that body.

I should note that since a bust slider of 50 is considered the "base" for the game, this
modpack will actually fit smaller-chested characters better as well.

### What armor is affected?

There's a list of armor affected [here](/varc/gearlist). For now only the main VARC mod is indexed.

### It looks like some armor is buggy/has holes/should be modified.

If you have a question, concern or a request please don't hesitate to [contact me](https://redstrate.com/about). Please keep in mind that I do not make money off of this mod (nor do I want to) and I work on this in my free time.

### What if I don't want to use VARC for (insert gear here) or (insert character here)?

Penumbra has the functionality to selectively disable parts of the mod, either for select gear or characters.

### What about armor that is intentionally supposed to be either tight-fitted or loose? Does this mod affect the realism of the armor in the game?

**No!** If the original intention of an armor was to be either loosely or tightly fitted, I have preserved that feature.

### Why did you make such a stupid mod??
