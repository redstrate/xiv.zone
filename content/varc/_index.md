Have you ever wondered why your female FFXIV character's body shape mysteriously
changes depending on whatever you decide to wear? No more!

![main comparison](varc/main-comparison.png)

The main reason why I created this mod is that some of the armors in the game do
not properly fit "large chested" female characters like my Viera. Compared to other mods that are refitting it to a completely different (and usually ridiculously NSFW) body type, this is meant for people who are fine with the vanilla body like me.

### Addons

These are kept as seperate mods because they are purely opinionated.

#### Better Butts

This changes some bottom armors to "canonize" the 2B butt. Thanks Square Enix.

**Note:** Since there is very little geometry in the original vanilla armor, there's only
so much I can do. Most of the armor looks fine though.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How do I install this?

This is a [Penumbra](https://github.com/xivdev/Penumbra) mod, so simply drag it into your Penumbra mods folder (normally located in `Mods` folder in your `Documents`).

### Why isn't this mod doing anything?

This mod changes the weight painting and vertices very slightly, and you may not notice any changes depending on your race. Please remember that I've only modified the **Hyur Female Midlander** armor, and will only affect races that use that body.

I should note that since a bust slider of 50 is considered the "base" for the game, this
modpack will actually fit smaller-chested characters better as well.

### What armor is affected?

I don't have a dedicated list yet, but you can check what armor is affected inside Penumbra itself. Since this is a mod I personally use, a lot of it is naturally armor
I like. Eventually, more and more armor will be added.

### Why the hell did you make such a stupid mod??
