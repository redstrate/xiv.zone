This is a collection of cross-platform, FFXIV modding tools. These don't use any pre-existing modding framework (Lumina, xivModdingFramework, etc) but instead my own custom modding library, libxiv.

The goal is to create a good set of tools that isn't based on WPF and C#, and can work cross-platform without having to resort to Wine.

**Note:** This is alpha level software, not intended to be usable in any capacity at the moment. Thus, I have not tagged any stable releases.
