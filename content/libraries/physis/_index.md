A modding framework for FFXIV written in Rust. Used in [Astra]({{< ref "astra" >}}) and [Novus]({{< ref "novus" >}}) but can easily be integrated into your own projects.

It's also usable from C, C++ and other languages that can interface with them with [libphysis](https://github.com/redstrate/libphysis).

See more information on the [crates.io page](https://crates.io/crates/physis).
