FFXIV's bone physics - which apply to character's hair, clothes and other body parts - are for some reason tied to the frame rate. If you run FFXIV above 30/60 FPS, the physics run so quickly that the bones only move slightly. In other words: the lower the frame rate the more "responsive" the physics look. This plugin aims to fix that, based on [Kirrana's plugin](https://github.com/Kirrana/xivlauncher_physics_plugin/) to be more opinionated with less options. This plugin locks the update at 48 FPS.
