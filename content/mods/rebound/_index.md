FFXIV's bone physics consist of wind and bounce physics. These apply to the character's hair, clothes and other body parts. However, some aspects appear broken on high framerates, especially those above 60 FPS. Notably bouncing happens so quickly that it's practically non-existent, and wind effects tend to appear jittery.

This plugin fixes this bug by locking updates to 60 FPS, and is based on [Kirrana's plugin](https://github.com/Kirrana/xivlauncher_physics_plugin/) to be more opinionated with less options.
