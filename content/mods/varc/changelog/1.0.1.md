- Fixed issue when neo-ishgardian top of aiming

There was a shape key used when equipping certain hand armor, and it was causing deformation. This should be looking better now.

- Removed some hidden folders

I accidentally uploaded a bunch of .DS_Store files, they're removed now!

Better Butts:
* Velveteen bottoms are now fixed, in some cases parts of the model were missing.
