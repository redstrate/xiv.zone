**Note:** This only **affects** armor tops.

### Addons

Some changes are separated into an addon, if you don't want to use them.

#### Better Butts

This changes some bottom armors to "canonize" the 2B butt. Thanks Square Enix.

**Note:** Since there is very little geometry in the original vanilla armor, there's only
