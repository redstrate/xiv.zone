title: "Astra - Frequently Asked Questions"

***Why should I use this over the official launcher?***

For **Windows** users, this launcher supports Dalamud plugins which enable useful functionality not available in the
vanilla game client. If you have multiple accounts, you'll find the profiles feature to be useful as well. Unlike the
PC launcher, Astra allows you to save your password.

For **macOS** users, the same features from above apply, since the Astra is cross-platform. The official launcher is also ran in Wine, which is slow, buggy and somehow manages to get stuck on your cursor. Everything else applies from above.

For **Linux** users, everything above applies still.

***Why should I use this over XIVQuickLauncher?***

For **Windows** users, you'll be happy with either since Astra, XIVQuickLauncher and FFXIV itself supports this just fine.

For **macOS** users, XIVQuickLauncher isn't even available so tough luck there.

For **Linux** users, you do have an easy Lutris install script to use XIVQuickLauncher - but Astra is completely native and all of the nice features listed above applies.

***What's some other neat stuff I should know?***

You can login into Sapphire servers using a different profile, bypassing the need for the Sapphire Launcher especially
since it only supports Windows. Naturally, Dalamud injection and everything else should work as well.

If you're looking for an even better and out-of-box FFXIV experience on macOS, check out XIV on Mac! They have  a similiar feature set and provide own bundled Wine with modern DXVK and other goodies.

***How secure is this? Can I trust Astra with saving my credentials and launching my game?***

The code is open source, and the boot/launcher portion is contained here and here for your code reading pleasure. For saving passwords, we leverage qtkeychain which uses your already secure system wallet and will not put anything in plaintext.
