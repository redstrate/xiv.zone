The stable version currently is **0.5.0**. Please let me know of any issues you have in the [tracker](https://todo.sr.ht/~redstrate/astra) or my [mailing list](https://lists.sr.ht/~redstrate/public-inbox).

See the [changelog](/astra/changelog/0.5.0) for this version.

### Flatpak

The Flatpak is currently unavailable. I estimate it will return at the end of February once the KDE Runtime is available for Qt6.

### Fedora

If you're a Fedora user, I also maintain the RPM which you can find in my [personal COPR](https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/redstrate/personal/).

### Gentoo

If you're a Gentoo user, I also maintain the ebuild which you can find in my [personal overlay](https://git.sr.ht/~redstrate/overlay).

### Arch Linux

If you're an Arch Linux user, I also maintain the [AUR package](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/astra-launcher). You can find the PKGBUILD [here](https://git.sr.ht/~redstrate/pkgbuilds/tree/main/item/astra-launcher/PKGBUILD) and the original Flatpak manifests [here](https://git.sr.ht/~redstrate/astra-flatpak).
