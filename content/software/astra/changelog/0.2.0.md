This is a major beta release which adds a bunch new features!

- Multiple profile support
  - All of the settings you already use are now configurable, per profile. This includes server type, directx mode, and a whole bunch of neat configurable things. For people testing Sapphire servers or different types of wine this should be extremely useful!
- Encrypted game argument support
  - On Windows, FFXIV "encrypts" (not really, just obfuscates) the game arguments otherwise your game login token (SID) is in plain-text. This now matches the behavior of the official xivboot.exe and also XIVQuickLauncher. This will become the new default option in the next release.
  - Big thanks to XIVQuickLauncher where the code is based off of, as well as the information on xivdev.
- Custom wine prefix/executable options on Linux and macOS

These bugs are also fixed:

- Windows dependencies are now copied when building
- Windows "open game directory" button now works
- The built-in game wine is now the default (for real this time) on macOS
