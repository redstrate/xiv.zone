*Note*: Please update immediately to 0.6, and bug me to update your package. 0.5.x Astra WILL fail to update on tomorrow, and your game WILL be left in an invalid state until repaired. 0.5.x releases are also EOL as 0.6 becomes the new stable.

* The UI is shifted around a bit, and I'm still trying to declutter everything.
* Fixed patching problems related to Dawntrail. Patching should be more reliable and less fussy.
* Allowed patching on maintenance days by delaying the gate check.
* Allow launching the game without logging in for debugging purposes.
* Check the Dalamud version before trying to launch it, now it should disable itself on unsupported game versions.
* Beginnings of Windows support, but it won't be available this release just yet.
* Patches are no longer kept in memory, but written to disk as soon as data is received.

Known Issues:
* While patching up to Dawntrail does function, downloading the patches is weirdly unreliable for unknown reasons. Astra will now automatically delete erroneous patches and warn you, but this is something I'll look into in a bugfix release.
* Astra will not warn you if you're low on disk space, so be careful Deck users as I almost filled up my internal drive while testing.
