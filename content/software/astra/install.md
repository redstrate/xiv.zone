The stable version currently is **0.5.1**. You can report issues either on [GitHub](https://github.com/redstrate/Astra/issues) or if you prefer then [contact me via e-mail](https://redstrate.com/contact).

See the [changelog](/astra/changelog/0.5.1) for this version.

### Flatpak

The Flatpak is currently unavailable but is being actively worked on.

### Fedora

I also maintain an RPM which you can find in my [personal COPR](https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/redstrate/personal/). After adding my COPR, run `dnf`:

```shell
dnf install astra
```

### Gentoo

I maintain an ebuild which you can find in my [personal overlay](https://git.sr.ht/~redstrate/overlay). After adding the overlay, run `emerge`:

```shell
emerge astra
```

### Arch Linux

I maintain the [AUR package](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/astra-launcher). For example, using [aurutils](https://github.com/aurutils/aurutils):

```shell
aur sync astra-launcher
```

### Source Code

If you don't see your preferred distribution listed, it's always possible to build it manually. Please refer to the [build instructions](https://github.com/redstrate/Astra/blob/main/BUILDING.md) for more help.
