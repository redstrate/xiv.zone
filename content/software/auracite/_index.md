Export your FFXIV character in portable, generic formats.

In the eventual future, the official servers will shut down and the Lodestone will disappear. This tool exports your character's data in machine-readable JSON (so it can be imported by something else) and a Lodestone-like HTML page which you can display in your browser.

See more information on it's [GitHub repository](https://github.com/redstrate/Auracite).
