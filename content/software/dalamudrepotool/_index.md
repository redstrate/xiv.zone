This program turns a repository's State.toml and other data into a repo.json that's consumable by Dalamud. It's a stripped down version of what [XLWebServices](https://github.com/goatcorp/XLWebServices) does for the main Dalamud repository.

See more information on it's [GitHub repository](https://github.com/redstrate/DalamudRepoTool).
